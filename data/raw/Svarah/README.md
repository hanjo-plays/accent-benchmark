## Dataset Description

- **Homepage:** [Svarah](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ai4bharat/Svarah)
- **Repository:** [Github](https://github.com/AI4Bharat/Svarah)
- **Paper:** [Svarah: Evaluating English ASR Systems on Indian Accents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15760)

## Overview

India is the second largest English-speaking country in the world, with a speaker base of roughly 130 million. Unfortunately, Indian speakers are underrepresented in many existing English ASR benchmarks such as LibriSpeech, Switchboard, and the Speech Accent Archive.

To address this gap, we introduce **Svarah**â€”a benchmark that comprises 9.6 hours of transcribed English audio from 117 speakers across 65 districts in 19 states of India, representing a diverse range of accents. The native languages of the speakers cover 19 of the 22 constitutionally recognized languages of India, spanning 4 language families. *Svarah* includes both read speech and spontaneous conversational data, covering domains such as history, culture, tourism, government, sports, as well as real-world use cases like ordering groceries, digital payments, and accessing government services (e.g., checking pension claims or passport status).

We evaluated 6 open-source ASR models and 2 commercial ASR systems on *Svarah*, demonstrating clear scope for improvement in handling Indian accents.

## Usage

The [datasets](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets) library enables you to load and preprocess the dataset directly in Python. Ensure you have an active HuggingFace access token (obtainable from [Hugging Face settings](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)) before proceeding.

To load the dataset, run:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset
# Load the dataset from the HuggingFace Hub
dataset = load_dataset("ai4bharat/Svarah",split="test")
# Check the dataset structure
print(dataset)
```

You can also stream the dataset by enabling the `streaming=True` flag:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset
dataset = load_dataset("ai4bharat/Svarah",split="test", streaming=True)
print(next(iter(dataset)))
```
